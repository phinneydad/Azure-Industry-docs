# Architectures

The cloud is changing the way applications are designed, including how data is processed and stored. Instead of a single general-purpose database that handles all of a solution's data, polyglot persistence solutions use multiple, specialized data stores, each optimized to provide specific capabilities. The perspective on data in the solution changes as a result. There are no longer multiple layers of business logic that read and write to a single data layer. Instead, solutions are designed around a data pipeline that describes how data flows through a solution, where it is processed, where it is stored, and how it is consumed by the next component in the pipeline.
